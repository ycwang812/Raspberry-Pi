In Brief: use IDLE3 (Python 3 in the Menu), and scripts
from the 'picraft' folder.

~~~

This workshop was first taught with the "mcpi" API, the official
API provided by Mojang for Minecraft: Pi Edition.

The revised material for this workshop uses the alternate
"picraft" API written by David Jones. This API is compatible
with the newer iterations of Python, and is written to match
pythons own syntactic style.

Use of the "picraft" API is highly recommened.
